      <p><h2>Why are good clothing product descriptions important in the fashion industry?</h2></p>

      <p><h3>Product pages and their descriptions are the cornerstone of any good eCommerce store.
         The main reason why is pretty self-explanatory – it’s how potential customers learn about your products.
          But, while some brands think they can get away with a few 
          stock images and copy lifted straight from the manufacturer’s website,
         your eCommerce content needs to be more than an afterthought. Here’s why:</h3></p>
         

         <p><h3><a class="a-style">85%</a> customers feel <a href="product.html" class="a-style">product content</a> is the most important factor when deciding to purchase an item online, as they cannot physically see, feel, or smell the item.</h3></p>
        <p><h3><a class="a-style">53%</a> of online customers will abandon their <a href="product.html" class="a-style">online purchase</a> if they can’t find an answer to a quick question.</h3></p>
         <p><h3><a class="a-style">85%</a> of shoppers surveyed say <a href="product.html" class="a-style">product information</a> and pictures are important to them when deciding which brand or retailer to buy from.</h3></p>

      <p><h3>Your fashion site’s product descriptions play a crucial role in attracting and engaging customers – new 
        and old. Your customers want a positive shopping experience, they want to find trust in your brand, and they
         want to be confident that they’re giving you their money for a good product. Your product page copy can
          ensure all of that happens. Here’s how to do it.</h3></p>
